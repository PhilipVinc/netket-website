In addition to [Built-in graphs]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _docs/graphs/hardcoded_graphs.md %})  NetKet
provides the freedom to define user's defined graphs, just specifying the relevant adjacency matrix
in the `Graph` section of the input.

For each $$ i $$ and $$ k $$, the adjacency matrix $$ A(i,k) $$ of a graph contains the $$ k $$-th neighbor of node $$ i $$.
For example, the adjacency matrix of linear lattice would simply be $$ A(i, 0) = i-1 $$ and $$ A(i, 1) = i+1 $$ (ignoring boundary effects here).

A powerful way of including graphs beyond the few [Built-in ones]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _docs/graphs/hardcoded_graphs.md %}) is to
use adjacency matrices generated by [NetworkX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NetworkX). An example is given below.

### Example
```python
import networkx as nx

#Generating a star graph with 11 nodes
#here 10 nodes are connected to a central node
G=nx.star_graph(10);

pars['Graph']={
    'AdjacencyList': G.adjacency_list(),
}
```
