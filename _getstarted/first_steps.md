Once you have installed NetKet, you can have a look at one of our Tutorials, to get to know the details of the input/output and
of the algorithms implemented.

We strongly suggest to follow the Tutorials in the order they appear in the menu on the left, starting from
the Ising model [tutorial]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _tutorials/ising.md %}) and then moving on to more complicated
cases.



When you progress a bit more, you might also want to try to provide your own
[Hamiltonian]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _docs/hamiltonians/custom_hamiltonians.md %}), your own [Graph]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _docs/graphs/custom_graphs.md %}),
or your own [Machine]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link _docs/machines/custom_machines.md %}).

Finally, if you feel brave, and want to contribute the ongoing development of NetKet, you can embrace one of our [Challenges]({{ "/challenges/home/" | prepend: site.baseurl }}).
