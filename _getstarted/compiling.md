Once you have fulfilled the necessary steps to get the [required libraries](../requirements/), you are just one step away from fully enjoying NetKet.

Download the latest stable version from here, and unzip the content in a folder of your choice.

At this point, just move to the NetKet folder and just do:

```shell
make
```

which will trigger the compilation and generate the executable file `netket`.

In the unlikely event you encounter difficulties with this operation, you can have a look at your `Makefile` and change
the configuration according to your system configuration.

Congratulations now, you have installed NetKet!
