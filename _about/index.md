Machine Learning techniques for Many-Body quantum systems are a young field of research.
NetKet aims at focusing the world-wide efforts.
If you would like to contribute to the development of NetKet, and undertake one
of those challenges, contact us. All the contributors will be involved in a collective
publication where NetKet 1.0 will be officially introduced.
